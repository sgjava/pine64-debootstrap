If you want to build your own Ubuntu 16.04 rootfs from [Longsleep's](http://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=376) [image](https://www.stdin.xyz/downloads/people/longsleep/pine64-images/ubuntu) then you stopped by the right place. You just have to run a few scripts (only one it interactive)
and you will end up with a rootfs archive to copy to SD.

### Requirements
* PINE64 (tested on 2GB version)
* SD card with [Longsleep's](https://www.stdin.xyz/downloads/people/longsleep/pine64-images/ubuntu) latest image
    * Use a second SD if you do not want to destroy the rootfs with Longsleep's image. It will need to contain the same image.
* PINE64 has Internet access

### Provides
* Minimal Ubuntu 16.04 server for headless use
    * You can add a desktop later on if you wish
    * Weighs in at under 1 GB uncompressed
* USB wifi enabled
    * Tested with ODROID Wifi Module 3
