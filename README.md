If you want to build your own Ubuntu 16.04 rootfs from [Longsleep's](http://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=376) [image](https://www.stdin.xyz/downloads/people/longsleep/pine64-images/ubuntu) then you stopped by the right place. You just have to run a few scripts (only one is interactive)
and you will end up with a rootfs archive to copy to SD.

### Requirements
* [PINE64](https://www.pine64.com) (tested on 2GB version)
* SD card with [Longsleep's](https://www.stdin.xyz/downloads/people/longsleep/pine64-images/ubuntu) latest image
    * Use a second SD if you do not want to destroy the rootfs with Longsleep's image. It will need to contain the same image in order to boot.
* PINE64 has Internet access
* HDMI display
* USB keyboard to log in and get IP address after first boot
* PC/laptop to SSH into PINE64

### Provides
* Minimal Ubuntu 16.04 server for headless use
    * You can add a desktop later on if you wish
    * Weighs in at under 1 GB uncompressed (slightly larger than Longsleep's image)
* USB wifi enabled
    * Tested with ODROID Wifi Module 3
    
### Prepare PINE64
* If you already have an SD with Longsleep's image then skip to [Create rootfs](#create-rootfs)
* [Create](https://www.stdin.xyz/downloads/people/longsleep/pine64-images/ubuntu/README.txt) bootable SD from Longsleep's image
* Insert SD card into PINE64 along with network cable, USB keyboard and HDMI display
* Power on PINE64
* Login as ubuntu/ubuntu
* `ifconfig` and get IP address assigned by DHCP.
* Switch back to your PC and `ssh ubuntu@ipaddress`
* Resize SD card
    * `cd /usr/local/sbin`
    * `sudo ./resize_rootfs.sh`
* `sudo apt-get update`
* `sudo apt-get upgrade`
* `sudo apt-get install git-core`

### Create rootfs
* `git clone https://github.com/sgjava/pine64-debootstrap.git`
* `cd pine64-debootstrap`
* Pick your native language pack instead of en if desired
    * `sudo nano minimal.sh`
* `sudo ./start.sh`
* Answer prompts required by debootstrap second stage
* `sudo ./finish.sh`
* Copy archive to your PC/laptop
    * `scp`

### Extract rootfs 
* Use a fresh SD Longsleep's image. We are going to delete the old rootfs, so insert the SD into your PC/laptop
