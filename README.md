If you want to build your own Ubuntu 16.04 rootfs from [Longsleep's](http://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=376) [image](https://www.stdin.xyz/downloads/people/longsleep/pine64-images/ubuntu) then you stopped by the right place. You just have to run a few scripts (only one is interactive)
and you will end up with a rootfs archive to copy to SD.

### Requirements
* [PINE64](https://www.pine64.com) (tested on 2GB version)
* 5V/2A PSU (make sure the PSU puts out stable power or it might not boot)
* SD card with [Longsleep's](https://www.stdin.xyz/downloads/people/longsleep/pine64-images/ubuntu) latest image
    * Use a second SD if you do not want to destroy the rootfs with Longsleep's image. It will need to contain the same image in order to boot.
* PINE64 has Internet access
* HDMI display
* USB keyboard to log in and get IP address after first boot
* PC/laptop to SSH into PINE64

### Provides
* Minimal Ubuntu 16.04 server for headless use
    * You can add a desktop later on if you wish
    * Weighs in at under 1 GB uncompressed (slightly larger than Longsleep's image)
* USB wifi enabled
    * Tested with ODROID Wifi Module 3
    
### Prepare PINE64
* If you already have an SD with Longsleep's image then skip to [Create rootfs](#create-rootfs)
* [Create](https://www.stdin.xyz/downloads/people/longsleep/pine64-images/ubuntu/README.txt) bootable SD from Longsleep's image
* Insert SD card into PINE64 along with 5V/2A PSU, network cable, USB keyboard and HDMI display
* Power on PINE64
* Login as ubuntu/ubuntu
* `ifconfig` and get IP address assigned by DHCP.
* Switch back to your PC and `ssh ubuntu@ipaddress`
* Resize SD card
    * `cd /usr/local/sbin`
    * `sudo ./resize_rootfs.sh`
* `sudo apt-get update`
* `sudo apt-get upgrade`

### Create rootfs
* `sudo apt-get install git-core`
* `git clone https://github.com/sgjava/pine64-debootstrap.git`
* `cd pine64-debootstrap`
* Pick your native language pack instead of en if desired
    * `sudo nano minimal.sh`
* `sudo ./start.sh`
    * Answer prompts required by debootstrap second stage
* `sudo ./finish.sh`
* Copy archive to your PC/laptop
    * `scp ubuntu@ipaddress:~/pine64-debootstrap/pine64-xenial-arm64.tar.gz .`

### Extract rootfs and boot
* Use a fresh SD Longsleep's image. We are going to delete the old rootfs, so insert the SD into your PC/laptop
* Mount SD and find path
    * Under Ubuntu 16.04 it mounted as `/media/username/rootfs` (change username as needed)
* Delete Longsleep's rootfs
    * `sudo rm -rf /media/username/rootfs`
    * `sync`
* Extract new rootfs to SD
    * `sudo tar -pzxf pine64-xenial-arm64.tar.gz -C /media/username/rootfs`
    * Wait a minute or so before sync (I waited for my SD writer activity light to stop blinking). I seem to have better luck this way producing a clean rootfs  
    * `sync`
    * Eject SD and boot in PINE64
    * Login as test (and password you assigned)
    
### After you can boot successfully
* Install linux-firmware cpufrequtils usbutils
    * `sudo su -`
    * `apt-get -y install linux-firmware cpufrequtils usbutils`
    * `update-rc.d ondemand disable`
    * <pre><code>cat << EOF > /etc/default/cpufrequtils
      ENABLE="true"
      GOVERNOR="conservative"
      MAX_SPEED=960000
      MIN_SPEED=480000
      EOF</code></pre>
    * `reboot -f`

### Configure wifi
* Plug in USB Wifi adapter and boot PINE64
* `lsusb`
    * `Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0bda:8176 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8188CUS 802.11n WLAN Adapter`
* `iwconfig`
    * <pre><code>wlx7cff80d3271f  IEEE 802.11bgn  ESSID:off/any  
          Mode:Managed  Access Point: Not-Associated   Tx-Power=0 dBm   
          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr=2347 B   Fragment thr:off
          Power Management:on</code></pre>
* Copy device name (wlx7cff80d3271f for example from above)
* `sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/wlx7cff80d3271f`
    * For DHCP
    <pre><code>auto wlx7cff80d3271f
    iface wlx7cff80d3271f inet dhcp
    wpa-ssid ssid
    wpa-psk password</code></pre>    
    * For static
    <pre><code>auto wlx7cff80d3271f
    iface wlx7cff80d3271f inet static
    address 192.168.1.69
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.1.1
    dns-nameservers 192.168.1.1
    wpa-ssid ssid
    wpa-psk password</code></pre>
* `reboot -f`
